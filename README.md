# Student Tracking Program

Welcome to the Student Tracking Program! This program is written in python language and is designed to enter student records for the given 3 main classes and to organize and display these records. Program saves the outputs in a file with the extension '.txt'. An effective program with very simple commands!

###  Additionally, it's worth noting that searching for records in a text file can be slow and inefficient for large datasets. If you're working with a large dataset or need to search for records frequently, you may want to consider using a database instead of a text file.
